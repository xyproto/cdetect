#### :microscope: CDetect

Utility for figuring out which compiler and compiler version was used for compiling an executable file for Linux (in the ELF format).

### Installation

With Go 1.17 or later:

    go install github.com/xyproto/cdetect@latest

### Example usage

    $ cdetect /bin/sh
    GCC 8.1.1

    $ cdetect /usr/bin/ls
    GCC 8.2.0

    $ cdetect testdata/rust_hello
    Rust 1.27.0-nightly

    $ cdetect go
    Go 1.11.2

### Features and limitations

* Supports detection of compiler name and version if an executable was built with one of these compilers:
  * GCC
  * Clang
  * FPC
  * OCaml
  * Go
  * TCC (compiler name only, TCC does not store the version number in the executables)
  * Rust (for stripped executables, only the compiler name and GCC version used for linking)
  * GHC
* Works even with stripped executables.
* Should work for recent versions of all of the above compilers. Executables produced with old versions of the compilers may need more testing.
